  Hello folks !


This is libmikmod, version 3.1.9, a portable sound library for Unix.
This version is mainly a bugfixed 3.1.8 version... with some new features,
though. Hopefully this will be the last version in the 3.1.x series, and 3.2
will be ready soon.
Check out the file 'NEWS' for more information.


>> BUILDING LIBMIKMOD
---------------------

- If you're not building libmikmod for the Macintosh, then you're lost in the
  sources. Go up one directory, and read the main README file.

So, you're on one of those esthetically-challenged Apple boxes ? Or on a
sober but nice classic beige box ? With a near-buttonless mouse ?

libmikmod can be built using Metrowerks Codewarrior (Version Pro 5 being used
to create the project file) and Apple MPW (only tested with CW compilers).

Read the file INSTALL in this directory for compilation instructions.
The projects will generate code for 68k as well as PowerPC processors.

HTML documentation of the library, for programmers, is located in the doc
directory.

For more information on this port, please contact Anders Bjoerklund
(email: afb@algonet.se, web: http://www.algonet.se/~afb)


>> THANKS
---------

We would like to thank everyone who contributed to libmikmod. Their names
are in the AUTHORS file for the significative contributions, but some other
names can be found in the NEWS file. Thanks a lot ! Keeping libmikmod alive
wouldn't be much fun without you.
