TODO list for future versions (or ROADMAP if you prefer)
=============================

**** for the next major release, libmikmod 3.2:

- bugfixes
- ability to have several modules in memory (it doesn't work in all cases in
  the current version)
- integration of the LINA (LINA Is Not A3D) companion library written by
  David Banz.
- total module length computation
- ability to seek in modules in smaller chunks than patterns

NOTE that the last three items will make the shared library version number
     increase again (this will be libmikmod.so.3). All changes marked for the
	 3.x series will not need another increase, to end the madness.

**** during 3.2.x maintenance releases:

- a NAS (Network Audio System) driver
- DMF and PSM loaders
- loading of stereo and ADPCM wave files

**** hopefully in 3.x.x releases:

- bugfixes
- use of glib for better thread support (i.e. more portability)
- LIQ loader (see with Claudio Matsuoka)
- MED improvements (at least I hope so)
- software mixer improvements
- an OSS sequencer driver
- an ALSA sequencer driver

**** Will hopefully occur in 4.x

- bugfixes
- a TFMX loader (see with Claudio, too)
  
**** Plans for the 4.x series and later:

- bugfixes
- a well-defined module loader interface, allowing both libmikmod and xmp to
  share the same loader code (in cooperation with Claudio, of course)
- extending the feature list, at the request of the users: midi support ?
  mp3 support ? cdda support ? suggestions welcome.
