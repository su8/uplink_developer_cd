  Hello folks !


This is libmikmod, version 3.1.9, a portable sound library for Unix.
This version is mainly a bugfixed 3.1.8 version... with some new features,
though. Hopefully this will be the last version in the 3.1.x series, and 3.2
will be ready soon.
Check out the file 'NEWS' for more information.


>> BUILDING LIBMIKMOD
---------------------

- If you're not building libmikmod for Windows, then you're lost in the sources.
  Go up one directory, and read the main README file.

So, you're on an angry fruit salad Windows system, aren't you ? With those so
cute icons and an overflowed system tray ?

Currently, libmikmod can be build under Windows only with the Microsoft compiler
(but I suppose that the Watcom compiler and Metrowerks Codewarrior could be
used as well).
You'll need the DirectX SDK (if not included with the compiler) to compile the
DirectSound driver; version 5 or better is required. The standard Win32 SDK is
enough for the winmm driver.

Oh, I almost forgot: you need long filenames to compile libmikmod, but that
should not be a problem nowadays.

You might want to edit one of the files 'Makefile.dynamic' and
'Makefile.static' located in the 'win32' directory to suit your particular
compiler setup. Then, in the 'win32' directory, run

	nmake -f Makefile.static

to build a static library, or

	nmake -f Makefile.dynamic

to build a DLL with its import library. 
If the build fails, I'd like to hear from you to correct the problem.

Be warned that both Makefiles put their object files in the same directory.
If you want to switch between the two makefiles, don't forget to do a make
clean first:
  
	nmake -f Makefile.dynamic clean
	
(or the same command with Makefile.static).

To make your library ready to use, copy the file '..\include\mikmod.h' to your
compiler include directory, and 'mikmod.lib` to your compiler library
directory. If you built a DLL, you'll also have to put 'mikmod.dll' somewhere
in your PATH.

HTML documentation of the library, for programmers, is located in the doc
directory.


>> THANKS
---------

I would like to thank everyone who contributed to libmikmod. Their names
are in the AUTHORS file for the significative contributions, but some other
names can be found in the NEWS file. Thanks a lot ! Keeping libmikmod alive
wouldn't be much fun without you.
