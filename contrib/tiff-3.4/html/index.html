This documentation is best viewed using a graphical browser that supports
the latest HTML directives for formatting documents.  In particular,
this document was authored
for viewing with version 1.1 or newer of the
<A HREF="http://home.mcom.com/comprod/products/navigator/index.html">Netscape Navigator</A>.
</H5>

<P>
This software provides support for the <I>Tag Image File Format</I> (TIFF),
a widely used format for storing image data.  The latest version of
the TIFF specification is <A HREF=document.html>available on-line</A>
in several different formats,
as are a number of <A HREF=ftp://ftp.sgi.com/graphics/tiff>TIFF Technical Notes (TTN's)</A>.

<P>
Included in this software distribution is a library, libtiff, for
reading and writing TIFF, a small collection of tools for doing simple
manipulations of TIFF images on UNIX systems,
and documentation on the library and
tools.  A small assortment of TIFF-related software for UNIX
that has been contributed by others is also included.

<P>
The library, along with associated tool programs, should handle most of
your needs for reading and writing TIFF images on 32- and 64-bit
machines.  This software can also be used on older 16-bit systems
though it may require some effort and you may need to leave out some of
the compression support.
