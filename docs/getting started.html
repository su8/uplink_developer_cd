      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">This 
        guide is intended to get you up and running with the Uplink Dev CD as 
        quickly as possible. It will show you how to get Uplink to compile on 
        your PC, using Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0. We will be assuming you have 
        some knowledge at least of compilers, C++ etc.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>1. Install 
        Uplink</b></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Fairly 
        self explanatory really, but you'd be suprised. You won't be able to run 
        any of the binaries you compile unless you have Uplink installed and ready. 
        </font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>2. Copy data 
        to Hard Disk</b></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">You 
        need to copy all the neccesary directories onto your hard disk. The directories 
        you will need are:</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>/contrib</b> 
        (all external libraries used by Uplink)</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>/lib</b> 
        (all our own internal libraries used by Uplink)</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>/source</b> 
        (the main source tree)</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Copy 
        those three directories into your Uplink directory on your Hard Disk.</font></p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>3. Prepare 
        project file</b></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Load 
        the workspace uplink/source/uplink.dsw into Developer Studio. We used 
        version 6.0, but you shouldn't have any problems with any other versions. 
        You should see all of our internal libraries listed in your workspace, 
        as well as the Uplink project itself. Make sure Uplink is the currently 
        active project.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">We need 
        to tell Developer Studio where the base directory is for the Uplink source 
        code. Bring up the project settings dialog (project-&gt;settings) and 
        select the project &quot;Uplink&quot;. Click the &quot;C/C++&quot; tab 
        and select the &quot;Preprocessor&quot; category from the drop down menu. 
        There should be a box that says &quot;Additional Include Directories&quot;. 
        Currently it will say something like &quot;C:\Development\UplinkDevCD\source&quot;, 
        plus a bunch of other library directories. You need to change that first 
        location to point to your Uplink source directory, eg &quot;C:\games\Uplink\source&quot;.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Click 
        Ok, cross your fingers, and press F7 to build everything. The compiler 
        will now build all of the support libraries in sequence, followed by Uplink 
        itself. The whole process takes about ten minutes on my computer. </font></p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>4. Running 
        your new Exe</b></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The 
        compiler will have replaced your uplink.exe file with the newly compiled 
        one. Just run the new Uplink.exe as normal from your Uplink directory. 
        If you are preparing a patch you might want to generate different filenames 
        to avoid clashing with other people's exes, eg &quot;Uplink_MyNewPatch.exe&quot;. 
        That way people will be able to have different patches in operation at 
        once. </font></p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>5. A quick 
        tour</b></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">This 
        isn't the place for detailed source code documentation, but I will point 
        out a few interesting hot-spots in the 110,000 lines of C++ code that 
        make up this game.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><i>uplink/source/app/globals.h</i></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Contains 
        a number of #defined variables that determine what sort of game to build, 
        ie Demo, Full game, Test game etc. You can enable cheats from here if 
        you like. You can also set options for debugging messages.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><i>uplink/source/game/data/data.h 
        and data.cpp</i></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Contains 
        almost all of the balancing / tweaking variables used in the code. You 
        can totally rebalance the game from this file. You can change everything 
        from the time taken to level up, to the starting conditions, to the probabilities 
        used in the Mission Generator. All of the descriptions of the hardware 
        and software are in here. It's worth noting you will probably need to 
        do a full recompile to get this new data in, and even then you may need 
        to start a new profile.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><i>uplink/source/app/opengl_interface.cpp</i></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Contains 
        a lot of code for rendering default windows, buttons, icons etc. If you 
        were interested in rewriting Uplink's graphics code then this would be 
        the place to start.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><i>uplink/source/world/generator/missiongenerator.h 
        and missiongenerator.cpp</i></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">One 
        of the most important files in the whole tree, this file contains all 
        the code for generating missions that appear on the BBS screen, and for 
        checking to see if the player has completed the missions. All the missions 
        have a fairly standard format. If you're thinking of adding new missions, 
        this is the place to start.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><i>uplink/source/world/generator/plotgenerator.h 
        and plotgenerator.cpp</i></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">This 
        is where you will find Uplink's background plot, hard-coded as a script 
        with Acts and Scenes. Complex and messy stuff. There is a Word document 
        on your Developer Cd in the &quot;Other&quot; directory which details 
        the plot and shows how it's broken down into Act and Scene. Use this as 
        your index into the Plot Generator. Best of luck.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">It's 
        worth noting that a log of code in the generator directory is only run 
        when a new user profile is created. So if you modify the worldgenerator 
        or the plotgenerator, you won't see those changes until you start a new 
        user. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Finally, 
        a few generic places to find things: (I know how hard it can be to find 
        your way around someone elses code sometimes)</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">All 
        in-game tools eg decrypter, log deleter etc : <i>uplink/source/interface/taskmanager/</i></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">All 
        local interfaces eg email, worldmap, IRC : <i>uplink/source/interface/localinterface/</i></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">All
